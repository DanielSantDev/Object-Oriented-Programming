#  Object Oriented Programming Java Repository.
###  Programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects.
* Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods.
* Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data. Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity.
* Methods are functions that are defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object.
* Attributes are defined in the class template and represent the state of an object. Objects will have data stored in the attributes field. Class attributes belong to the class itself.
###  Four Principles of OOP
* Inheritance: child classes inherit data and behaviors from parent class
* Encapsulation: containing information in an object, exposing only selected information
* Abstraction: only exposing high level public methods for accessing an object
* Polymorphism: many methods can do the same task
